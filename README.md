About
</h2>

YouTube has an extremely invasive [privacy policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10364219) which relies on using user data in unethical ways. They store a lot of your personal data - ranging from ideas, music taste, content, political opinions, and much more than you think.

**Watube (Lycaon-Project Fork)** aims at improving the users' privacy by being independent from Google and bypassing their data collection as much as possible. The app only sends the minimum amount of data necessary to ensure that the app works, e.g. it only loads the YouTube-video you want to play without tracking your behavior when using the app.

### 🎯 This Fork's Focus

While maintaining the original project's privacy-first philosophy, **Watube specifically focuses on**:

- ⚡ **Performance Optimization** - Optimize for 120 Hz screens and to reduce battery consumption
- 🐛 **Bug Fixes & Stability** - Comprehensive testing and reliability improvements
- 📱 **Android 15+ Compatibility** - Full support for latest Android features and requirements
- 🎨 **Enhanced User Experience** - Smoother animations and improved responsiveness
- 🔒 **Security Hardening** - Reduced attack surface and stricter network/backups rules

### 🆕 Notable changes in Watube

**Performance & resources**

- Polling loops of the player UI (`position`, queue buttons, chapter name, seek bar, chapter index) only do work when their value actually changed, slow down while paused, and are stopped when the player is detached
- SponsorBlock/chapter time bars no longer allocate `Paint`/`Rect` objects on every frame
- Search suggestions are debounced (300 ms) instead of firing one request per keystroke
- The watch position is persisted every 5 s instead of every second, and immediately on pause/end; it is also cached in memory so list rows don't have to query Room while binding
- DiffUtil now identifies rows by their stable id (video url, primary key, …), so lists rebind and reload thumbnails only when their content really changed
- Download progress notifications are throttled to 2 updates per second
- The player back buffer was reduced from 3 minutes to 1 minute to save memory

**Quality, security & maintenance**

- Strict network security config (cleartext disabled, only local development hosts exempted), encrypted-app backups that exclude the account token, and removal of the unused boot receiver
- Automatic update checks against [github.com/Lycaon-Project/LibreTube](https://github.com/Lycaon-Project/LibreTube/releases/latest), throttled to once every 12 hours, plus a manual check in the settings
- **Maintenance → Clear cache** in the settings wipes the image cache, the HTTP cache and the leftover app cache in one tap
- Reliable error handling in the SABR data source and picture-in-picture, bounded retry loops (media service connection, feed notifications) instead of infinite ones
- A unified Coil image loader and a shared HTTP cache are created once for the whole app

**Design**

- New **Watube aqua** accent (default), rounder component shapes and a raised bottom navigation bar
- The app title is rendered with a colour gradient in the toolbar and the about screen

Differences to NewPipe
</h2>

LibreTube's main difference to NewPipe is that it has a much stronger focus on user experience. LibreTube uses the modern [Material 3 Expressive](https://m3.material.io) design, supports external APIs such as SponsorBlock, ReturnYouTubeDislike, or DeArrow, and allows you to synchronize your user data across devices, e.g. via Piped.

While LibreTube only supports content from YouTube, NewPipe also allows the use of other platforms like SoundCloud, PeerTube, Bandcamp and media.ccc.de.

Both, LibreTube and NewPipe, are great clients for watching YouTube videos. There's no general answer about which one is better, just try them both and see which one fits you best.
